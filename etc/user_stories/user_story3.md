# [Automate resale process] 

## **User Story**
As a user, 
I want a feature to automate the resale process 
so that it is easier to sell more products.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- It's easier to sell products (takes less steps to launch a product for sale than it would manually)
- We can list the product for sale from the website (after its been physically sent to Amazon by the user)
- We can view existing listings

---

## **Notes**
- Be able to adjust prices from the websites and ads
- Automation means decisions made by the computer without user approval, could lead to undesirable results that could be fault of the software
