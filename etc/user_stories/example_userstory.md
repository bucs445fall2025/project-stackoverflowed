# Initiative Tracking

## **User Story**
As a **Dungeon Master**,
I want **a way to automatically track player initiative**,
so that **I donâ€™t have to manually adjust the turn order each round**.

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- Users can **enter initiative rolls** for players and NPCs
- The system **automatically sorts** the turn order
- Players and DM can see **who's next in the turn order**
- The system highlights **the active player's turn**
- The turn tracker **updates automatically** after each round

---

## **Notes**
- Consider integrating with **existing dice rolling tools**
- Ensure the UI is **clear and readable during a fast-paced session**
