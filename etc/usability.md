Discuss your planned GUI, and identify the UI elements in your project that support the usability quality attributes:

- Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design? Overall first-time users should be able to locate the signup button, log in, pick a category, and view deals without needing guidance
    * “Sign Up” link on the landing page. It uses a familiar label and is placed directly under the main welcome message, making it obvious where a new user should start.
    * Centered welcome screen with a clear call-to-action ("Rocket ship icon). Helps guide the user into the login/signup flow immediately
    * Simple login form (username + password). Matches what users already expect from most online services
    * Navbar at the top of the dashboard. Text links like Product Finder, Amazon Dashboard, Chat Bot, and Saved communicate their purpose clearly without needing extra explanation
    * Deal cards showing Amazon vs competitor. Presented in a clean side-by-side layout, making it easy for new users to understand what they’re looking at the first time they see it


- Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks? Returning users can navigate straight to the tools they need, making the workflow fast and repeatable
    * Category search bar. Users can immediately jump into product research without navigating through extra menus
    * Persistent navigation bar. Quick access to all major pages (Dashboard, Saved, Chat Bot) in one click
    * Saved Products page. Gives users fast access to previously favorited deals, which speeds up decision-making
    * Chrome extension. Lets users find deals directly from an Amazon product page without needing to open the main website, reducing extra steps
    * One-click “Save Deal” buttons – Minimizes the number of actions required to store products

- Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency? Even after time away, users should be able to log back in and re-find key features quickly because the flow doesn’t rely on unusual or complex design choices
    * Straightforward page labels (Login, Product Finder, Saved Products). Using standard terminology helps users recall where to go
    * Consistent purple/galaxy theme across all pages. Visual consistency makes it easier for users to recognize where they are in the app
    * Familiar layout patterns. Login forms, category dropdowns, and side-by-side product cards are common UI concepts, so users are likely to remember them
    * Chrome extension layout mimics the website’s card structure. Helps bridge memory between the two interfaces


- Are there changes you can you make to your UI to improve its usability? Explain your reasoning.
    * Add hover tooltips or text labels to buttons in the Chrome extension. This would help users understand what each option does without guessing.
    * Improve consistency in button styling. Ensuring all action buttons share similar shape, color, and placement would reinforce memorability and reduce mistakes
