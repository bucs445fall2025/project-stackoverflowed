        Project StackOverflowed ("we", "our", "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. 
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you

        If stored, your data may be kept securely in our managed database (such as MongoDB Atlas)
        and accessed only by authorized systems. We implement industry-standard security measures 
        to protect your data from unauthorized access or misuse.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or rent user data. Data is only shared with
        trusted service providers (e.g., hosting platforms, Amazon API services) as needed to

        applicable privacy laws.
      </p>

        at any time from your Amazon account settings.
